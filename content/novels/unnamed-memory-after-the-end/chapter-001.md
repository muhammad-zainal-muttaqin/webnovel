# Chapter 1 - A Quiet Ceremony

Three hundred years of fear had taught the continent to whisper whenever the word _witch_ crossed their lips. Now, inside the cathedral of Arclight, the murmurs softened to breaths. Gold-veined pillars reached toward a carved ceiling, and the scent of white lilies drifted through the air like a promise of peace.

Tiinarsha stood at the end of the aisle with her hands gently folded, ivory sleeves falling like fresh snow. The infamous witch of the Blue Moon looked almost fragile beneath the sunlight pouring through the stained-glass windows. Beside her, dressed in royal navy, King Oscar allowed himself a quiet smile�a smile that carried every stubborn promise he had made to reach this day.

�I warned you,� Tiinarsha murmured without taking her eyes off the far doors. �Marrying a witch is the sort of decision that cannot be undone.�

�And I warned you that I would always choose you,� Oscar replied. He kept his tone light, but his hand shifted against the hilt at his side�a habitual gesture from years spent walking into danger for her sake. �Now all that remains is a simple �I do.��

She almost laughed. Almost. �You are incorrigible.�

Outside, trumpets were about to sound. Inside, the bride and groom lingered in the last moment of silence before a continent would witness the end of an era�the moment when the strongest witch alive chose to become queen.

The doors opened, the orchestra swelled, and the whispers finally ceased.
