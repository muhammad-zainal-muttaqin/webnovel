# Extra - Serpent's Afterimage

Rain tapped gently against the palace windows. Tiinarsha sat at her writing desk, a candle burning low beside her, when a ripple of old magic brushed her senses. It was faint�an afterimage�but unmistakable: the serpent that had once devoured the moon.

She slipped on her cloak and left without waking Oscar. The castles of Arclight slept peacefully while she followed the lingering aura through silent corridors and out into the inner garden. Moonlight caught on the wet stones, and the scent of wet earth mingled with the faint, cold trace of the beast.

Near the reflecting pond, the magic coalesced into a shimmering outline. A memory had been left behind, perhaps by worshippers who still whispered the serpent�s name. Tiinarsha raised her hand and offered it a simple truth. �The world does not belong to your hunger anymore.�

Light spilled from her palm, gentle yet absolute. The echo faded, unable to resist the will of the witch who had already rewritten fate once before. Tiinarsha turned back toward the palace, the night calm once more. She wondered whether to wake Oscar upon her return�or let him sleep and tell the story over breakfast.
