# Afterword

Thank you for reading _Unnamed Memory -after the end- I_. This short collection began as a personal challenge: how would Tiinarsha and Oscar settle into ordinary life after years of keeping the world safe? Once I started writing, I realised they never truly get to be ordinary�but they can be happy.

I am grateful to everyone who supported the original series, and to the editors who trusted me with these follow-up stories. If you have favourite moments or characters you would like to see again, please let me know through the usual channels. Your enthusiasm keeps this world alive.

Until the next volume�may your nights be filled with magic and your mornings with peace.
